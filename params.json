{"name":"Autodesk Fusion 360 API","tagline":"","body":"###Welcome to the Autodesk Fusion 360 API GitHub Site\r\nIt's here that you can find links to get more information about developing scripts and add-ins for Fusion. There are also  many repositories of sample code written by Autodesk and also links to many community repositories where other developers are sharing their Fusion programs.\r\n\r\n### Getting Started with Fusion's API\r\nFor a quick overview of the API you can view a recording of a recent webcast.\r\n\r\nYou can learn more about the API and how to get started by reading the [Fusion API documentation](http://fusion360.autodesk.com/resources/akn/view/NINVFUS/ENU/?guid=GUID-DE5B70A6-AA7D-439D-8284-2F0382AB6C90).\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at https://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
